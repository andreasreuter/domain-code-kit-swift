# Domain Code Kit for iOS
With this incredible domain-driven design toolkit, you can easily start coding in Swift using these principles. I recommend to read further literature on https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/categories/domain-driven-design and on my Medium bookmarks https://medium.com/@AndiReuter/list/domain-driven-design-b4ec21b36221.

I actively maintain this toolkit. :rocket:

You can contact me at any time andireuter86@gmail.com.
